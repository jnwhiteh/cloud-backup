# Deleted facet

The **Deleted** facet indicates that the item on OneDrive has been deleted. In this version
of the API, the presence (non-null) of the facet value indicates that the file was
deleted. A null (or missing) value indicates that the file is not deleted.

**Note**: While this facet is empty today, in future API revisions the facet
may be populated with additional properties.
